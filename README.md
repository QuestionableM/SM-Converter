# How to Use
## Requirements
This program requires you to have a copy of scrap mechanic installed on your computer!

If the program won't be able to find the path to Scrap Mechanic automatically, you can always specify the path manually in `Settings -> Options -> General`

## How to convert blueprints / tiles
- Select the appropriate converter type
    - In order to convert tiles you have to set the converter type to `Tile Converter`
    - In order to convert blueprints you have to set the converter type to `Blueprint Converter`
- Select any item in the list, press the `Convert` button and configure the export settings as you wish
- Converted models will be stored in `ConvertedBlueprints` or `ConvertedTiles` directory which is located in the same place as the executable

In case you couldn't find the tile / blueprint in the list, you can always specify a folder that contains blueprints / tiles in the `Settings -> Options -> Paths`<br>

If you want to select a tile / blueprint manually, press on the `...` button and select the `.tile` file for tiles, and `.json` or `.blueprint` file for blueprints

## How to set the correct materials easily in Blender
In case you don't want to spend hours configuring the materials on the exported model, there's a tool just for you! [SM-Converter-Plugin](https://github.com/QuestionableM/SM-Converter-Plugin) allows you to assign the correct materials in a single click!
