# SM-Converter
A tool that can convert Scrap Mechanic blueprints and tiles into 3D models

# How to Use
## Requirements
This program requires you to have a copy of scrap mechanic installed on your computer!

If the program won't be able to find the path to Scrap Mechanic automatically, you can always specify the path manually in `Settings -> Options -> General`

## How to convert blueprints / tiles
1. Select the appropriate generator type
    - In order to convert tiles you have to set the generator type to `Tile Converter`
    - In order to convert blueprints you have to set the generator type to `Blueprint Converter`
2. Select any item in the list, press the `Convert` button and configure the export settings as you wish

In case you couldn't find the tile / blueprint in the list, you can always specify a folder that contains blueprints / tiles in the `Settings -> Options -> Paths`<br>

If you want to select a tile / blueprint manually, press on the `...` button and select the `.tile` file for tiles, and `.json` or `.blueprint` file for blueprints
